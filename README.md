# CP2---Final-Project---Grasshopper

## Project Description
** Pavilion in the Golden Gate Park  **
The pavilion will be created and designed using Grasshopper in order to achieve parametric forms that are almost impossible to create using only 3D modeling tool. The Pavilion can be used for outdoor activities, such as camping, sitting, picnicking. It creates interesting light and shadow effects and also make outdoor space more inhabitable.

## Program Used
- Rhino 6 (3D Modeling)
- Grasshopper
- Weaverbird
- Kangaroo
- Cocoon

## Component Parts
I will create these as final deliverables for my project:
- screenshot of Grasshopper scripts/components as well as the process models
- multiple renderings of the pavilion showing the space in different angles, suggesting how people should interact with the pavilion
- rendered video: a walkthrough video of  the space with change of time in a day showing different atmospheric conditions inside

## Challenges (before starts)
I'm only comfortable with 3D modeling software and I haven't use Grasshopper solely by myself yet. I will try to teach myself using online tutorials. I've tried a couple of things in grasshopper before but it's hard to understand the underlining logic of the programs and control the forms using only scripts. In short, changing from a 3D modeling mindset to a systemetic mindset is the challenge and the key to success for this project. 


## Challenges (in the process)
- Hardware limitation
As the design getting more complex and having more parameters, it's taking more time to render the result in Rhino. I've encountered many difficulties when I tried to move one of the slider to test out which is right number for one of the parameters, such a the thickness of material. I asked others about why my program always crushed in this particular process and eventually find out it's because moving the slider will generate many counculations in a second, and sometimes it overload the computer's ability to process. The limitation of hardware unexpectly became the limitation for powerful systemetic modeling tools like Grasshopper, whitch I would never thought of before I actually go through the process. One way to get away with this limitation is to, instead of sliding the slider that generate many counculations, we should type in a specific number that only generate ONE result.

- Resource limitation
Online toturial about Grasshopper is limited. The possibilities of grasshopper is unlimited but there are only few typical Grasshopper outcomes have detailed step-by-step toturials for beginners. Designes need to try out many toturials to get basic understandings in order to get outside of these limiations and be able to create their own design in their mindes.

## Future Goals
To take one's programatic modeling further from this project, designers need to fully understand the logic behind creating one components. Creating the design in mind by combining own programatic components instead of relying too much on existing grasshopper pattern is the next level.
