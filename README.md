# CP2---Final-Project---Grasshopper

## Pavilion in the Golden Gate Park  
The pavilion will be created and designed using Grasshopper in order to achieve parametric forms that are almost impossible to create using only 3D modeling tool. The Pavilion can be used for outdoor activities, such as camping, sitting, picnicking. It creates interesting light and shadow effects and also make outdoor space more inhabitable.

## Program Used
-

## Component Parts
I will create these as final deliverables for my project:
- screenshot of Grasshopper scripts/components
- 1 render an image of the pavilion
- rendered video: a walkthrough of  the space

## Challenges (before starts)
I'm only comfortable with 3D modeling software and I haven't use Grasshopper solely by myself yet. I will try to teach myself using online tutorials. I've tried a couple of things in grasshopper before but it's hard to understand the underlining logic of the programs and control the forms using only scripts.

## Challenges (in the process)
As the design getting more complex and having more parameters, it's taking more time to render the result in Rhino.

## Timeline
- 4/12 Study online tutorials about basics of Grasshopper + Build model along with tutorials
- 4/19 Rationalized & control the forms - make them inhabitable and functional
- 4/26 Render images & Video
